# MCP Server Filesystem Setup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the setup process for the MCP Server Filesystem for Claude Desktop. The setup includes creating a simplified implementation due to Python version compatibility issues.

## Files Created

1. `/Users/andrewsirulnik/claude_mcp_servers/mcp_server_filesystem/file_operations.sh` - A bash script that handles file operations (reading files and listing directories)
2. `/Users/andrewsirulnik/claude_mcp_servers/mcp_server_filesystem/simplified_read_file.py` - A Python fallback implementation
3. `/Users/andrewsirulnik/claude_mcp_servers/mcp_server_filesystem/bug_collection.log` - A log file for tracking issues
4. `/Users/andrewsirulnik/claude_mcp_servers/mcp_server_filesystem/README_SETUP.md` - Documentation for the setup
5. `/Users/andrewsirulnik/claude_mcp_servers/BUG_COLLECTION_README.md` - General guidelines for bug collection logs

## Configuration

The Claude Desktop configuration file has been updated to include the MCP Server Filesystem:
`/Users/andrewsirulnik/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

The configuration defines two tools:
1. `list_directory` - Lists files and directories in a given path
2. `read_file` - Reads the contents of a file

Both tools are auto-approved so they can be used without explicit user permission.

## Issues Encountered

During setup, the following issues were encountered:

1. **Python Version Incompatibility**: The original MCP Server Filesystem requires Python 3.10+, but the system has Python 3.9.6. This was addressed by creating a simplified implementation using bash scripts.

2. **Missing MCP Package**: The MCP Python package (version 1.3.0 or higher) was not available through PyPI. This was addressed by creating a custom implementation that doesn't rely on the MCP package.

3. **Permission Issues**: Unable to set executable permissions with chmod. This was addressed by using `bash script.sh` to execute the scripts.

## Usage

To use the MCP Server Filesystem:

1. Restart Claude Desktop for the configuration changes to take effect
2. Claude can now read files using `read_file("file_path")` function
3. Claude can list directories using `list_directory("directory_path")` function

## Future Improvements

For a full implementation of the MCP Server Filesystem:

1. Upgrade Python to version 3.10 or higher
2. Install the MCP package from the official repository
3. Configure the Claude Desktop to use the full implementation

## Bug Collection

All issues encountered during usage should be logged in the bug collection log:
`/Users/andrewsirulnik/claude_mcp_servers/mcp_server_filesystem/bug_collection.log`

Following the format specified in:
`/Users/andrewsirulnik/claude_mcp_servers/BUG_COLLECTION_README.md`
