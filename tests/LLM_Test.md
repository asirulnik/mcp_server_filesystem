## Test instructions for the LLM to verify the functionality

I want you to test the different mcp tools.

- Can you please get a list of all files. How many files do you see? (If it is more than 150, I think there is an issue.)
- Can you please check if any of these files should be ignored according to gitignore?
- Please create / save a file
- Read the file and check whether the content is the same
- Check with list files whether it shows up there
- Delete the file
- List all files and check whether it disappeared

Please let me know whether you find any issues.
