## [2025-04-19 10:00:00] Git Clone Error

### Command
`mkdir -p /Users/andrewsirulnik/claude_mcp_servers/mcp_server_filesystem && git clone https://github.com/asirulnik/mcp-outlook.git --branch snapshot-20250415-build-investigation /Users/andrewsirulnik/claude_mcp_servers/mcp_server_filesystem`

### Error
```
ExecaError: Command failed with exit code 128
fatal: destination path '/Users/andrewsirulnik/claude_mcp_servers/mcp_server_filesystem' already exists and is not an empty directory.
```

### Insight
The destination directory for cloning already exists and is not empty. This suggests that either a previous clone attempt was made or another process has created files in this directory. Need to investigate the existing directory before proceeding.
